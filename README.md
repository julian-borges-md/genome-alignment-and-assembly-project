## Project Description

This notebook accompanies Module 3 of the *Genomic Data Science Specialization*. It contains annotated Python implementations and exercises for:

- Exact matching algorithms (Naive, Boyer-Moore)
- Pattern preprocessing with good suffix and bad character rules
- Online vs Offline algorithms
- Index-based search using k-mers
- Overlap graph construction
- Genome sequence reconstruction using suffix-prefix overlaps

The exercises are directly tied to the lecture materials and practical tasks outlined in the course.
